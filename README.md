# bdrgnlearn

### Classic machine learning algorithms implemented in plain Python / Numpy. 

# Highlights

### 1) [Random Forests.](bdrgnlearn/ensemble.py) 

#### My implementation of Random Forest gets 97% accuracy on breast cancer dataset:

### 2) [Decision Trees.](bdrgnlearn/tree.py)

#### Decision Trees are fully implemented from scratch:

### 3) [Linear models: LinearRegression and LogisticRegression.](bdrgnlearn/linear_model.py)

#### Here you can see bdrgnlearn's Linear Regression minimising loss on sample data:

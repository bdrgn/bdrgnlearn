# bdrgnlearn

### Classic machine learning algorithms implemented in plain Python / Numpy.

### 1) [Random Forests.](bdrgnlearn/ensemble.py) 

#### My implementation of Random Forest gets 97% accuracy on breast cancer dataset:

### 2) [Decision Trees.](bdrgnlearn/tree.py)

#### Decision Trees are fully implemented by me, too:

### 4) [Sequential Neural Networks.](bdrgnlearn/neural.py) 
### 5) [KMeans clustering.](bdrgnlearn/cluster.py)

# Principles

* In this project I value readability over performance. 

* Each algorithm implementation is an interactive lecture note. 

* Here is a [demo](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bdrgn/bdrgnlearn/blob/master/DEMO.ipynb) showing algorithms at work.

# bdrgnlearn

### Classic machine learning algorithms implemented in plain Python / Numpy. 

# Highlights

### [Random Forests](bdrgnlearn/ensemble.py)


| Algorithm  | Performance | Visualization
| ------------- | ------------- |  ------------- | 
| [Random Forests](bdrgnlearn/ensemble.py)  | 97% Accuracy on Breast Cancer dataset  | ![](demo_gifs/rf_demo.gif) |
